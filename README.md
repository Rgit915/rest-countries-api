## My process

1. **Setup** the project using Vite and Tailwind CSS.
2. Created reusable UI components like `Header`, `SearchInput`, and `CountryDetail`.
3. Managed theme toggling using `useState`, `useEffect`, and `localStorage`.
4. Added search and filter functionality using controlled inputs.
5. Configured routes with `react-router-dom` to support dynamic pages.
6. Implemented the single country detail page and border country navigation.
7. Styled all components responsively with Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.



## âœ… What I Learned

- How to structure a React app with nested and dynamic routes
- Lifting state and using prop drilling effectively
- Storing and retrieving user preferences from `localStorage`
- How to use Tailwind CSS for dark mode and responsive design
- Creating shared layout components using `<Outlet />` from React Router
- Mapping over and filtering complex data structures
- Writing clean and descriptive Git commit messages
